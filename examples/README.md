Hi.  The examples directory could use its own readme...  ...but for now the code *is* the README.   
Just look at the comments in the source before you try to run anything. ;-)

Few quick thoughts:

The two *_setup* files are what you want to run.  They will grab data from elsewhere and provide prompts and instructions. 

The "headgames" thing is just a GUI for a "live demo" I'm working on, but I don't expect it to be easy for anyone else to use (yet).
